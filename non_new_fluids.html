    <p class="conText"> Non-newtonian fluids are very interesting types of fluids. 
        They don’t behave in an intuitive way and it can be hard to predict how the will 
        react under certain scenarios. A non-newtonain fluid is simply a fluid that does 
        not follow Newton’s law of viscosity. This law states that a liquid’s viscosity will
         only change based on the amount of pressure and its temperature. An example is wate
         r when it is cooled into ice, the change in temperature changes its viscosity. Simila
         rly, if you threw something into water, a rock for example, the water would flow aroun
         d it. With a non-newtonian fluid, the higher pressure applied from the force of the roc
         k falling onto it could cause it to harden, becoming more like a solid and stopping th
         e rock. This would decelerate the rock and make it apply less pressure causing the no
         n-newtonian fluid to act like a liquid again and change viscosity, allowing the rock
          to fall through. Non-newtonian fluids are worth studying as they have several pract
          ical applications.  Some types of clay for instance, or non-newtonian fluids and are 
          used to help buildings resist earthquakes with their non-newtonian properties.
