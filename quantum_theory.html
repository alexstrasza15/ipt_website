    <p class="conText"> Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics dealing with motion and interaction of subat
        omic particles. This incorporates the concepts of energy such as wave/particle duality, as well as the
         uncertainty principle, represented by the schrodinger's cat paradox where the cat is simultaneously 
         dead and alive at the same time. This also includes the multiple dimensions and universes theory, called
          the many-worlds theory, where every single decision you make branches off into infinite amounts o
         f dimensions based on which decision you chose. It keeps splitting off as decisions are made. It is th
         e theory of nature at very very small, subatomic levels, and the inherent randomness in the world.

                Schrodinger's Cat and the Uncertainty Principle
            </p>
    <p class="conText"> This paradox involves a cat, poison, a geiger counter, radioactive material, and a hammer 
        inside of a sealed container. The amount of radioactive material is minuscule enough that it only has a 50% 
        chance of being detected over the course of an hour. If the geiger counter detects radiation, the hammer smashes 
        the poison, killing the cat. This would mean that it is impossible to know whether the cat is dead or alive 
        until someone opened the sealed container. This is called superposition in quantum physics, and works on the
        atomic level, and the Copenhagen interpretation as it is called, states that an object can exist in all possible
        configurations until it is observed, whence the entire system breaks down to a single configuration. This is a 
        paradox as the cat can only be alive or dead in the real world, and cannot be both. However, when it isnâ€™t 
        observed it is impossible to be sure what state the cat is in, alive or dead, leading to the paradox where the
        cat is dead and alive, dead, alive or none of those at all at the same time.
