    <p class="conText"> The emergence of complex patterns and behaviours given enough entities 
        who are following the right set of local rules.
   </p>

 <p class="conText">
One example is schools of fish. There is no one fish leading the group as they move through the sea 
and avoiding predators. Every fish is following a set of local rules in regard to their interaction 
with other fish. 1. To stay close but not too close to your neighbours. 2. Not to stop swimming. With 
a small number of fish this doesnâ€™t look spectacular in any way, but the with enough fish, following 
these rules, they can reliably evade predators as a group.

</p>

<p class="conText">
Another example is the way our brains work, althrough they are nothing more than a collection of simple
neurons which each simple functions, they can combine together to create simple "circuits" and start to form
 simple math functions like addition and subtraction. From there they can combine further to form decision 
making patterns and allow us to live our daily life.
