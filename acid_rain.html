    Acid rain is what we call precipitation that is unusually acidic and harmful to many organisms. 
    This means it has a low PH level and can therefore cause harm or not be processed or used optima
    lly by organisms. This acidity can be caused by the water reacting with gas particles such as ca
    rbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. These gases are usually emissions from factorie
    s and places which burn fossil fuels along with natural sources such as volcanoes.  This means t
    hat an area with factories can have a higher chance of receiving acidic rain, which is a problem
     since currently humans rely on many factories that produce these pollutants for things like energy and electricity.

Interestingly, earth is not the only place where acid rain can occur. Venus also has the potential 
to house acid rain as it contains carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and water vapour, the main ingredien
ts of acid rain. The main difference is that on venus, itâ€™s so hot that the acid rain would evaporat
e before it even reached the surface.
