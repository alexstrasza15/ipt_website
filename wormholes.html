    <p class="conText"> Wormholes are essentially portals to another position in spacetime, bending it so that links can be formed like when 
        folding over a piece of paper. For example, point A is in the top left and point B in the bottom right of an A4 page. They are far ap
        art, but when you fold the paper they can be touching, and if an ant was at point A then it would be able to easily traverse onto point B.
    This is, in principle, what a wormhole does, which is creating a path, a hole, between points in spacetime and sometimes even dimensions.
 </p>

 <p class="conText">
However, there are a lot of debates on whether such a portal could ever be viable for human use, and it looks like with our current state of tech
nology a day when we could actually utilise this type of rift is very far away, and it is only being used as concepts in games such as the Portal
 series, where a gun was developed with the ability to create wormholes that actually somehow stayed open and didn’t instantly kill you.

<p class="conText">
How a wormhole can form
</p>

<p class="conText">
The way that a wormhole can be created is by entangling black holes then pulling them apart to create a sort of a rift between space, time 
and even alternate dimensions. To exist, a wormhole would need negative mass. This means that you must take out more matter than is actually
there within the wormhole itself. This is obviously impossible… Right? However, through research and scientific studies, we have discovered t
hat at any given area, particles pop into existence. However, a negative version of the same thing is also created, cancelling each other out a
 nd therefore popping out of existence. The negative version of this particle actually has negative mass, and so we would need to put a la
 rge number of these into a wormhole in order for it to stay open. Using mathematics, we can calculate that the total negative mass for a do
 or-sized wormhole to stay open… Is 7*10^19 TONS. This is equal to around the mass of the moon, and it means that you would have to create mas
 s equal to the moon, exploding that amount of mass every time you create a wormhole in order to open the portal and keep it open.

<p class="conText">
Ways with which wormholes can kill you
</p>

<p class="conText">
If you have somehow managed to open a wormhole, then you would have to fulfil the requirements above first to even be able to keep it open, w
hich would essentially create the same energy as exploding the moon, and would easily kill you. If you somehow manage to survive this, then yo
u are now bending spacetime, creating even more energy. As well as this, when you try to go through a wormhole, the edges of the wormhole are f
olding in on itself as you’re bending spacetime which smashes atoms together, creating extreme heat, radiation and energy just like nuclear fusi
on on the Sun creates light. Except now you’re standing right next to it. If you manage to survive through that, then you’re completely inhuman.
